Place a Hebrew-capable TrueType font here named `NotoSansHebrew-Regular.ttf` (preferred), or `Rubik-Regular.ttf` / `Assistant-Regular.ttf`.

This repository cannot include the font binary. To enable Hebrew rendering, download a suitable font (for example, Noto Sans Hebrew, Rubik, or Assistant) and save it as:

backend/assets/fonts/NotoSansHebrew-Regular.ttf

The evidence certificate PDF generator loads the first available font in that order.
